                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
                Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque his mother
                Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
                Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in
                his family.His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and
                large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost
                most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a
                Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and
                local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to
                and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had
                to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
                to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost
                over time, apart from the ancestral home.

                After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under
                Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space
                Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle
                (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had
                first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received
                the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.Kalam addresses
                engineering students at IIT GuwahatiIn 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in
                Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight
                Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite
                Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.

                Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential
                election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term
                lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which
                was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President, and both
                the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the Samajwadi Party
                announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field
                clear.On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee
                and his senior Cabinet colleagues.
